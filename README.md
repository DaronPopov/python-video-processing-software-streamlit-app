Real-Time Video Processing App

This Python application utilizes Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface for real-time video processing. It allows users to apply various image processing techniques to both uploaded video files and live webcam streams.

Features:

Upload and Process Videos: Users can upload video files in various formats (mp4, avi, mov) and process them using a combination of techniques.

Real-Time Processing: The app can process live webcam streams in real-time, allowing for immediate visual feedback.

Image Processing Techniques: The app supports the following techniques:

Motion Detection

Face Detection

Optical Flow Analysis

Edge Detection

OCR (Text Recognition)

User-Friendly Interface: Streamlit provides a visually appealing and interactive interface, making it easy to select processing options and view results.

How It Works:

User Interface: The app utilizes Streamlit components to create a simple and intuitive interface. Users can select desired processing options through checkboxes and upload video files or start the webcam feed.

Video Processing: The app leverages OpenCV and Tesseract libraries for processing video frames. The apply_processing function takes a frame and applies the selected processing techniques.

Display Results: The processed frames are displayed in real-time using Streamlit's st.image function. For uploaded videos, the processed frames are assembled into a new video file that can be downloaded.

Concurrency: The app utilizes multi-threading to process video frames concurrently, improving performance.

Installation and Usage:

Install Dependencies:

pip install streamlit opencv-python pytesseract
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash

Ensure that Tesseract OCR is installed and configured on your system.

Run the App:

streamlit run video_analysis_app.py
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash

This will launch the Streamlit app in your web browser.

Code Structure:

Video Processing Functions: Contains functions responsible for applying individual processing techniques to video frames.

Streamlit UI Setup: Configures Streamlit's layout and styles for a visually appealing interface.

Processing Options and File Upload: Handles user inputs for processing options and uploaded video files.

Process Video Button: Triggers video processing for uploaded files.

Real-Time Video Processing Button: Starts real-time processing of the webcam feed.

Limitations:

The app currently uses a simple motion detection technique. More advanced algorithms could be implemented for improved accuracy.

The OCR implementation relies on pre-processing to improve accuracy, but it might not work optimally for all scenarios.

Potential Improvements:

Implement more advanced motion detection algorithms.

Enhance OCR accuracy with more sophisticated pre-processing techniques.

Add additional processing options, such as color filtering or object detection.

Provide more granular control over processing parameters.
